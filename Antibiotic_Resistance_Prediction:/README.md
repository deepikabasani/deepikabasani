# Predicting Antibiotic Resistance in Bacterial Strains Using Machine Learning

This project uses genomic data and machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria.

## 📊 Dataset
- Genomic features of bacterial strains
- MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) values
- Resistance labels (resistant or susceptible)

## 🛠️ Preprocessing & Modeling
- Imputed missing data
- Scaled features using StandardScaler
- Random Forest used for classification
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

## 🔍 Key Features
- Azithromycin resistance gene
- Ciprofloxacin resistance gene

## 🧪 Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search
- k-mer based genetic feature engineering
- Compare with other models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting)

## 📁 Files
- `Antibiotic Resistance Prediction.ipynb` – code notebook
- `Antibiotic Resistance Prediction.pptx` – final presentation
- `metadata.csv` – cleaned dataset

## 🚀 Outcome
This model helps in predicting antibiotic resistance effectively, which can aid in better treatment planning and healthcare strategy.
